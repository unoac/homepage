# üèéÔ∏è Homepage (WIP)

A super simple homepage app containing local links in a yaml file.

Partly a learning project and something I've wanted to build for a while as other solutions are too complex for my needs and I've needed to learn how to use Docker correctly for a while. Most of this could have been achieved using a static site generator, but I thought overengineering a simple app sounded more logical =).
